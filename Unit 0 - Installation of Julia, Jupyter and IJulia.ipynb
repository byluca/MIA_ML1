    "# Introduction to Julia Language\n",
    "\n",
    "For the implementation of the practice exercises, there are several options in terms of programming language.  Among the many options available, three possibilities have been considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Matlab. This is a scientific language with many years of experience, and therefore has the advantage of having a large number of modules (called Toolboxes) for almost any operation you want to perform, along with excellent documentation.  This makes it a very suitable language to get started and learn. However, its main disadvantage is that it is necessary to purchase a licence to use it.   This requirement has meant that many companies do not opt for this option, so in practice it is not as widely used as Python at a business level\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python.  It is undoubtedly the most widely used.  It is a modern, simple language, with a large number of modules and abundant documentation, although without reaching the number or quality of Matlab. It is free and open source, and general purpose, which has made it one of the most widely used languages in the business world today.  Moreover, one of the first Deep Learning libraries, called Tensorflow, was developed by Google for this language, which has drastically increased the community of developers of machine learning applications in this language.  In addition, libraries such as Scikit-Learn also allow the use of other machine learning techniques such as decision trees or Support Vector Machines.  The biggest problem with this language is that it is not a scientific language but a general-purpose language, and vector programming is not supported natively, but through the numpy library, which leads to a considerable loss of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Julia.  This is an emerging, very short-lived, fully scientific language developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  Its first stable version is only a few years old, and it is currently under intense development.  For this reason, it does not have the same number of modules as Matlab or Python, although the number of modules it has is growing rapidly, as the language is free and open source.  This language has been developed as an intermediate point between Matlab, as a scientific language, and Python, as a simple, open source language, with a higher execution speed than both. Its main drawbacks are that the developer community is not as large as that of Python, and the number of modules is not as large as that of Matlab, and, given its short period of time, it has not yet made its presence felt in the business world.\n",
    "\n",
    "As has been indicated, it is a language that does not yet have a large presence at the enterprise level, however, this is mitigated by three important factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Having acquired Python language skills in other subjects, this subject provides an opportunity to learn a scientific language that completes the knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Several of the world's most prestigious institutions such as Berkley, Stanford or MIT recomend and teach this subject in this language because of the control it offers when it comes to researching or implementing details without losing performance. This nearly guarantees that in a short period of time it will start to be seen in the enterprise level.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Although Python is the most widely used language at the enterprise level, the Scikit-Learn library is also available in Julia.  So, their learning in this subject would mean that they could also use it in their work in a company in Python effortlessly, as they would have knowledge of both the library and the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia installation is pretty straightforward, whether using precompiled binaries or compiling from source. Download and install Julia by following the instructions at [https://julialang.org/downloads/].\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Older Mac users**: Installing Julia might be troublesome due to deprecated compilers. In case of errors during installation, it might be worth trying to install it via [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/julia/). After MacPorts [installation](https://www.macports.org/install.php/), Julia can be installed just by `sudo port install julia`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be worth to also install jupyter in a local environment to perform some test. This can be done by executing the following command, if you do not have it already installed."
